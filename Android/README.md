1. Make sure you have Pycharm and python 2 installed. In pycharm, go to File -> Settings to check if pycharm is using python 2 or 3. 
2. Go to the GotMalware repository and download the repository. Unzip it, and save all of the files in the “Android” folder to one pycharm project (All of the files must be in the same project). You can do this my opening up two file explorer windows (1: your downloads folder; 2: wherever your pycharm projects are saved to) and dragging the files over.
3. Go to file -> settings -> your project name -> project interpreter. Click on the plus sign. Import the following modules: GRR-M2Crypto, matplotlib, numpy-mkl, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, seaborn. If there is an error, go to steps 4 or 5.
4. If there is an error, first try this: navigate to the Python27 -> Scripts folder on your computer by using the cd command. In the Scripts folder, type pip install moduleName
5. If there is an error importing anything in that way, go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and find the necessary file. Download it, and use the file explorer to move it from the downloads folder to the Python27 -> Scripts folder. Then go to the Scripts folder. Hold Shift+right click, then open a command terminal. Navigate to the Scripts folder through the command terminal, then do pip install firstThreeLettersOfModuleName press the tab key, then press enter.
6. Download the chilkat file for Python 2.7 from this link: https://www.chilkatsoft.com/python.asp#winDownloads. Open it in file explorer, and extract the zip file. Set up Python as an environment variable: in file explorer, right click on “This PC”. Go to properties -> advanced system settings -> Environemnt variables -> select path in the lower window, click edit, and add “C:\Python27” After this, navigate to the downloads folder in the command terminal and run the setup.py file. 
7. When you have all of the modules imported, make sure your dataset is in order. The ML_Malware_Detection_Android file is the only one you will need to change anything in. Open it up and go to the 220-221 lines. Change the directory path to the path on your computer that leads to the folders containing the clean and malicious files.
